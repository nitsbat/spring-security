Spring security means application level security. i.e the api or the app which we have exposed.
The authenticated people only have the authority to use or call your API.

Application security framework examples are:

1) Login/Logout Security
2) Allow/Block users to access URL's to only logged in users.
3)  Allow/Block users to access URL's to only logged in users with special roles.

Also when we add spring security , it resolves all the very common vulnerabilities.

Spring Security can do 
1) Username/password authentication.
2) LDAP 
3) app level authorization
4) Intra app authorization like OAuth
5) Microservice security (tokens , JWT) 
6) Method level security


Authentication and Authorization

Authentication - it means who you are. it confirms that users are who they claim to be. e.g username and password . this is known as
				 knowledge based authentication. other example is phone/text messages which is known as possession based authentication.
				 

Authorization - Are the users allowed to do this. It gives the authenticated users the permission to access a resource.
				It is done by granting authority to the user which the application needs to do before authorising which means when the
				user is logged in or authenticated it should be given what operations the user can be done like the group of authorities
				for every user logged in.

Principal - It is currently logged in user. As the user login into the system the application establish a principal behavior to that user.
		    cozz of this we dont have to always privide the username or password for everything use in the application.
			
Granted Authority - way of providing authorisation.

Roles - Group of authority.
